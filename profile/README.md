## Is or will multiplayer be supported?
Multiplayer will be supported in Stage 3 for each plugin. The main goal is to release all plugins to be working in single-player and with updates make them work in replicated scenarios.
Multiplayer support will be handled by a professional.

## How much does it cost?
Mountea Framework is and will remain free. The goal is to encourage game creators to make unique products and to enrich the Unreal Community.
We only ask you to share and rate the tools so a wider range of creators can get involved.
